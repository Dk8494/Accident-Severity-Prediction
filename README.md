# Accident Severity Prediction

This repository contains code and resources related to predicting the severity of accidents using machine learning techniques. The project leverages data pipelines, Python scripts, and Jupyter notebooks to preprocess data and build predictive models.

## Features

- End-to-end data pipelines for accident severity prediction
- Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation
- Support for scikit-learn based machine learning pipelines
- Pipeline images and pickled models for reproducibility

## Repository Structure

- `Pipelines.py`: Python script containing pipeline definitions and logic
- `Pipelinesscikit_learn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for interactive data analysis and model training
- `Pipelines.png`: Visualization of the data/model pipeline
- `pipelines.pkl`: Pickled file containing saved pipeline objects
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dk8494/Accident-Severity-Prediction.git
   cd Accident-Severity-Prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   - Python 3.x
   - scikit-learn
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - (Other dependencies as required in your pipeline or notebook)

3. Explore the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Pipelinesscikit_learn.ipynb
   ```

4. Review the pipeline logic in `Pipelines.py` and the pipeline image in `Pipelines.png`.

## Usage

- Modify and run the Jupyter notebook to explore and train models on your accident dataset.
- Use or extend the pipelines in `Pipelines.py` for custom ML workflows.
- Load the pre-trained pipelines from `pipelines.pkl` for inference or further analysis.
